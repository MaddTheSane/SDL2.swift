# SDL2.swift

SDL2 bindings for Swift.

This is a work in progress and not yet suitable for public consumption.

If you fancy getting involved, check out [swift-sdl-workspace](https://github.com/jaz303/swift-sdl-workspace) for a starting point.

## Examples

```swift
import SDL2_swift

let win = Window(title: "Hello from SDL!", width: 1024, height: 768)
```
